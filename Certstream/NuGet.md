# Certstream

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akacdev/Certstream/master/Certstream/icon.png)

C# library for real-time SSL certificate processing using the Calidog Certstream API.

## Usage
This library provides an easy interface for interacting with the Certstream API, allowing you to process newly issued SSL/TLS certificates in real time.

You can either listen for all spotted certificates with all details available or save on bandwidth by only requesting raw hostnames, if applicable.
By default, the library will connect to a public Certstream server instance hosted by Calidog, but you can specify a custom instance instead.

To get started, import the library into your solution with either the `NuGet Package Manager` or the `dotnet` CLI.
```rust
dotnet add package Certstream
```

For the primary classes to become available, import the used namespace.
```csharp
using Certstream;
```

Need more examples? Under the `Example` directory you can find a working demo project that implements this library.

## Properties
- Built for **.NET 8**, **.NET 7** and **.NET 6**
- Fully **async**
- Extensive **XML documentation**

## Features
- Connect to a Certstream server and receive certificates in real time
- Parse and process over 200 issued certificates per second
- Automatically reconnect when connection is lost
- Updates are exposed through events
